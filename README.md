# LinkedBST
Realization of LinkedBST

linkedbst.py: The module was improved by me. There you can discover the difference in time between finding element in list and tree. For executing the program you need to create the object LinkedBST. Then execute the function demo_bst(path_to_file). For example:
<img width="220" alt="Знімок екрана 2022-05-21 о 16 14 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96167224/169653229-2cd0cf5d-3831-4945-85a1-08578e968fac.png">

After running the program, you will see the time and explanation of things, which happened.

So now you can see the difference in time between finding in balanced tree, or just tree, or list and so on. Moreover, there are a lot of information in functions. What function does, from which list the tree was created and so on.
